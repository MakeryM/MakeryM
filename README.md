# Welcome to the Makery Mission

### Currently out of my depth

---

*My story? So glad you asked.*

*As the fine business of designing buildings waved a gentle bye-bye due to the abismal state of the industry, I took it as an opportunity to pivot (as serious people in serious positions like to put it), to learn a new set of skills. This is just that.*

Things I already know (not many):
- smidge oh html and css
- ??
- ???
- see, out of my depth!
- downright master in Archicad
- somewhat skilled in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator
- sometimes I'm funny

Things I'm looking to explore:
- how does one actually get a website up and running
- what about an app
- hacking, what's that about
- automating things and stuff
- generally making fun little projects a reality
